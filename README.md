# Cooperative Drone-Assisted Mobile Access Network for Disaster Emergency Communications

## Project Overview

This project is a simulation of a Cooperative Drone-Assisted Mobile Access Network. It uses drone-mounted base stations (DBSs) to restore communication links in disaster-affected areas. The project implements the COACH (COoperative DBS plAcement and CHannel allocation) algorithm to optimize DBS placement, channel allocation, and traffic offloading.

**Key Components:**
1. Drone-Mounted Base Stations (DBSs)
2. Macro Base Stations (MBSs)
3. Mobile Users (MUs)
4. COACH Algorithm for dynamic DBS deployment and channel allocation

## Core Concept

The core idea is to create a resilient communication network that can be deployed swiftly in disaster zones. DBSs provide temporary communication infrastructure by linking mobile users (MUs) within affected areas to macro base stations (MBSs) outside these zones.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- C Compiler (for `coach_algorithm.c`)
- MATLAB (for COACH algorithm simulation)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
